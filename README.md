### Hello, nice to meet you! 👋

I'm frozenbits, or you can call me Adji, whichever suits your fancy.

I'm a Backend developer, but I also am familiar with Flutter for Android development.\
So kind of not-that-fullstack since I prefer bit of both but not too much since I mostly focus in the backend.\
I have experience with Python🐍 and the Django framework. For Android, I also have experience with Kotlin and Flutter (Dart).\
I am also familiar with with some basic server management and shell scripting commands.

I have an interest in video games, so mostly my motivation to code comes from them.\
You probably have heard of this somewhere but I started my adventure with starting my own dedicated Minecraft server when I was a kid.\
So, most of my early days are "coding" in yaml config files (if you can call a kid typing as coding, that is, haha).\
But setting up my own dedicated Minecraft server actually taught kid-me a lot about permissions, syntaxes, networking, and console commands!

Will probably be updating this readme as time goes on. But for now, see you! 😁

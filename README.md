### Hello, nice to meet you! 👋

I'm frozenbits, or you can call me Adji, whichever suits your fancy.

I'm a Flutter / Backend developer. Kind of fullstack but not-that-fullstack since I prefer bit of both but not too much.\
I have experience with Kotlin and Java, but I switched to Flutter since developing with it is less stressful.\
But if push comes to shove, especially if a feature doesn't exist in Flutter, then I'll jump in Kotlin to fix it as best as I can.
I am also familiar with with Python🐍 spaghetti scripting and some basic server management be it via AWS or any regular linux VPS provider.\

I have an interest in video games, so mostly my motivation to code comes from them.\
You'll probably have heard of this somewhere but I started my adventure with starting my own dedicated Minecraft server, so most of my early days are "coding" in yaml (if you can call a kid typing as coding, that is, haha).

Will probably be updating this readme as time goes on. But for now, see you! 😁

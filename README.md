### Hello, nice to meet you! 👋

I'm frozenbits, or you can call me Adji, whichever suits your fancy.

I'm a Flutter / Backend developer. Kind of fullstack but not-that-fullstack since I prefer bit of both but not too much.\
But mostly I dabble in the dark magic of spaghetti scripting with Python🐍.\
Other than Python, I can also do some basic server management be it via AWS or ye olde regular linux VPS provider.

I have an interest in video games, so mostly my motivation to code comes from them.\
You'll probably have heard of this somewhere but I started my adventure with starting my own dedicated Minecraft server, so most of my early days are "coding" in yaml (if you can call a kid typing as coding, that is, haha).

Will probably be updating this readme as time goes on. But for now, see you! 😁
